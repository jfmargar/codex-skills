I want you to generate documentation using the existing project files.

Instructions:
1. Read the file docs/structure.json.
2. Read and follow exactly the instructions in prompts/generate_flows.md.
3. Using those instructions, generate a Markdown document.
4. Write the result to a new file at docs/flows.md.
5. Do not explain anything in the chat.
6. Do not invent screens, states, or flows.
7. If something is not present in docs/structure.json, omit it.

Your output must be ONLY the contents of docs/flows.md.
